The Lord Chancellor has backed the independence of the UK's judiciary but stopped short of condemning attacks on senior judges over the Brexit ruling.
The Bar Council had demanded Liz Truss respond to criticism from some MPs and newspapers over the decision that MPs should vote on triggering Article 50.
The Daily Mail branded judges "Enemies of the people"; the Daily Express said it was "the day democracy died".
Ms Truss said the "impartiality" of the courts was "respected the world over".
On Thursday, the High Court ruled Parliament should vote on when the government can trigger Article 50, beginning the formal process of the UK leaving the EU.
Three judges found that the government could not start the formal process by using the royal prerogative alone, and would need the backing of both the Commons and the Lords.
The government is seeking to overturn the decision at the Supreme Court - the UK's highest court of appeal - next month.
Following fierce criticism of the ruling, the Bar Council of England and Wales called for Ms Truss - who as Lord Chancellor is responsible for courts, prisons, probation and constitutional affairs - to defend the judges.
In a statement on Saturday, the council - the professional body representing barristers - said it regretted "the lack of public statement by the Lord Chancellor condemning these attacks".
It called on her to condemn them "as a matter of urgency".
"A strong independent judiciary is essential to a functioning democracy and to upholding the rule of law," it said.
